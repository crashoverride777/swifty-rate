## Deprecated

This library has been deprecated and will no longer be maintained in the future. Its simply time to move on from supporting iOS 10 in your apps.

## Requirements

- iOS 9.3+
- Swift 5.0+

## Installation

### Cocoa Pods

[CocoaPods](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/quick-start#streamlined_using_cocoapods) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. Simply install the pod by adding the following line to your pod file


```swift
pod 'SwiftyRate'
```

### Swift Package Manager

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.

To add a swift package to your project simple open your project in xCode and click File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency.
Than enter `https://github.com/crashoverride777/swifty-rate.git` as the repository URL and finish the setup wizard.

Alternatively if you have a Framwork that requires adding SwiftyRate as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/crashoverride777/swifty-rate.git", from: "3.5.0")
]
```

### Manually

Alternatively you can copy the `Sources` folder and its containing files into your project.

## Usage

- Add the import statement when using CocoaPods or SwiftPackageManager

```swift
import SwiftyRate 
```

- Request review

As Apple describes in the documentation for SKStoreReviewController 

"Although you should call this method when it makes sense in the user experience flow of your app, the actual display of a rating/review request view is governed by App Store policy. Because this method may or may not present an alert, it's not appropriate to call it in response to a button tap or other user action."

UIViewController
```swift
let ratingsRequest = SwiftyRate.Request(
    afterAppLaunches: 15,
    customAlertTitle: "Enjoying this app"?,
    customAlertMessage: "Tap the stars to rate it on the App Store.",
    customAlertActionCancel: "Not Now"
)
SwiftyRate.requestReview(ratingsRequest, from: self)
```

SKScene (needs to be called outside/after DidMoveToView or it will not work)
```swift
if let viewController = view?.window?.rootViewController {
    let ratingsRequest = SwiftyRate.Request(...)
    SwiftyRate.requestReview(ratingsRequest, from: viewController)
}
```
